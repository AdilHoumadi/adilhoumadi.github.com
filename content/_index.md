I'm **Adil Houmadi**, a software engineer with over seven years of hands-on experience in backend, infrastructure, and web development. My tech journey began with an internship at BePark in 2013, and I've since navigated through roles at TAKTIK sa, hireme, adidas, and most recently, KOR Financial.

## My core expertise lies in:
- **Backend Development**: Crafting robust APIs and microservices.
- **Infrastructure**: Setting up and managing environments using AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- **Kafka Streaming**: From deploying and maintaining Kafka platforms at adidas to developing Kafka connect plugins, 
I've delved deep into the world of real-time data streaming.

A Linux aficionado, I often find myself scripting in Golang and Python to automate and optimize tasks. 
I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Haute Ecole 'LÃ©onard de Vinci', Brussels, 
and also hold a specialized degree from Institut SpÃ©cialisÃ© de Technologie AppliquÃ©e. Additionally,
I'm a Certified ScrumMaster, emphasizing my commitment to agile methodologies.

On this blog, I'll be sharing technical deep-dives, tutorials, and insights from my experiences,
especially around programming, DevOps, Kafka Streaming, and Kubernetes. Whether you're here to learn, 
share, or collaborate, I hope you find value in my posts.

**Happy coding!** ðŸ‘‹
